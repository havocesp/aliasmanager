Alias Manager
Manages bash alias/function scripts using a GUI (gtk-based).
Edit, View, Load, Save aliases/functions in one or more files.
Easily integrate alias/function scripts into bashrc with a mouse click.

Note to user:
*Looks for /home/username/.bashrc or bash.bashrc first, then in /etc/.
*Uses elevation commands kdesudo/gksudo (whichever comes first) for operations that
 require root.
 
 
Technical Info:
